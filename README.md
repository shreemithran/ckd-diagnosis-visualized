Using machine learning to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on clinical indicators, with a focus on visualizing model performance for interpretability and decision-making.

#  Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project uses machine learning models to predict the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on patient clinical data. With a focus on visual interpretability, the goal is to make model performance more transparent and relevant for medical decision-making.

##  Research Question
How effectively can ML models predict CKD using clinical indicators, and how can visualizations support interpretability for healthcare professionals?

##  Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease)
- **Records**: 400
- **Features**: 26 (including blood pressure, serum creatinine, red blood cells, etc.)
- **Target**: Presence or absence of CKD

##  Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

 Decision Tree achieved **96% accuracy**, outperforming KNN in all metrics.

##  Key Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap
- Pair plots
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix
- Decision tree graph (planned)

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- seaborn / matplotlib
- pandas / numpy
